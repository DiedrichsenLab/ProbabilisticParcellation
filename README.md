## Notebooks / Code to replicate different sections of the paper

### Estimation of the atlas



### State dependency of functional atlases
Plotting MDS plots for different single dataset parcellations (Fig 1B & 1C & 1D) & Statistics for between-dataset ARI (similarity; normalized to within-dataset ARI) between all datasets and the task-general (MDTB) and rest-based (HCP) data:
```notebooks/evaluate_mds.ipynb```


### Fusion outperforms other atlases

Plotting DCBC & Statistics DCBC (Fig 1E & 1F):
```notebooks/evaluate_dcbc.ipynb```

Comparison of existing atlasses to fusion
```notebooks/evaluate_existing.ipynb```

### Symmetric and Asymmetric atlasses
Plotting symmetry (boundary and functional symmetry, i.e. functional lateralization) and comparing asymmetric and symmetric atlas versions:
```notebooks/symmetry.ipynb```


### Fine level of granularity advantageous for individual parcellation
Statistics on DCBC of 68 regions vs 40 regions in individual DCBC  (Fig 1F):
```notebooks/evaluate_dcbc.ipynb```


### Hierarchical atlas organisation
Dendrogram (Fig 2D):
```scripts/atlas_paper/dendrogram.py```
Some manual adjustments had to be made on the produced figure, because the internal ordering of the leaves within a domain is randomly generated by the dendrogram plotting algorithm (for example M4a and M4b are ordered M4b, M4a).


### Characterization of regions
Motor regions
```notebooks/atlas_paper/motor.ipynb```

Action regions
```notebooks/atlas_paper/action.ipynb```

Demand regions
```notebooks/atlas_paper/demand.ipynb```

Sociolinguistic regions
```notebooks/atlas_paper/social.ipynb```

Localizing individual regions
```notebooks/atlas_paper/social.ipynb```

### Cortical Connectivity

Cortical connectivity models are estimated and evaluated in the repository

```diedrichsenlab/cortico_cereb_connectivity``` denoted ```ccc``` for short.

Models were trained evaluated ```ccc.run_model```, which is called from ```ccc.scripts.scipt_train_eval_models.py```

The final model evaluation results reported in the paper can be found in ```ccc.notebooks.Evaluate_model_int.ipynb```.

To summarize the connectivity pattern by cerebellar regions:

```
import cortico_cereb_connectivity.scripts.script_summarize_weights as csw
csw.make_weight_map('Fusion','05')
```

To summarize further by cortical ROI:

```
T = csw.make_weight_table(dataset="Fusion",extension="06",cortical_roi="yeo17")
```

Summary figures (by yeo17)

```

Full connectivity maps:

```

### Function and boundary (a)symmetry

Size comparison of left and right regions (voxel-wise) of the asymmetric atlas
```scripts/atlas_paper/symmetric_comparison.py```

### Individual localization

To get individual parcellations (previously saved as pytorch tensor to save
time) run the following script:
```scripts.individual_variability.export_uhats(model_name)```

Which Calls:
```evaluate.get_individual_parcellation(model_name)```

Plotting the individual parcellations: (Fig XA):
```notebooks/individual_parcellation.ipynb```

Calculating and plotting individual variability (Fig XB):
```notebooks/individual_variability.ipynb``` TODO CARO: WHICH ONE ENDED UP IN THE PAPER? HIGHLIGHT IN NOTEBOOK

which calls:
```scripts.individual_variability.calc_variability(Data, Info, subject_wise=False):```

Plotting probability maps for parcels (Fig XC):
```notebooks/individual_group.ipynb```
```plot.plot_parcel_prob```

Comparing group and individual parcellations with varying length of data (Fig XD):
```notebooks/individual_group.ipynb```

### Model to atlas
```export_atlas.export_map``` takes a marginal probabilitiy of a arrangement model and generates the probseg and dseg to save in the ProbabilisticParcellationModel/Atlases directory.


### Final export / Production of the atlas
The final step is to take the 2mm atlas in MNISymC2 space and resample it to 1mm isotropic in SUIT, MNIAsym and MNISym spaces defined in the `FunctionalFusion/Atlases` directory. The reslicing is done on the `probseg.nii` files and then a new `dseg.nii` file is computed.

```scripts.export_atlas_script.py```

which calls

```
export_atlas.resample_atlas('NettekovenSym32','MNISymC2','MNI152NLin2009cSymC')
```

The files are then copied for inclusion into the `cerebellar_atlases` repository.

### Spatial subdivision of the atlas
The spatial subdivision of the atlas is then produced in each atlas space seperately - in the final 1mm space.
